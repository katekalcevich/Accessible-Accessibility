# Learn about digital accessibility

Courses and online resources to help you learn how to create accessible electronic documents, websites and apps.

Accessibility barriers make it difficult or even impossible for some people to use digital content. When you create content without barriers, more people can use your documents, website or app.

## Theory

When learning about accessibility, it&#39;s helpful to understand:

1. how people with disabilities use the web,
2. [how assistive technology works](https://github.com/katekalcevich/accessible-accessibility/blob/master/Digital%20accessibility%20testing%20tools.md) (so that you can use it to test accessibility), and
3. how to use specific accessibility techniques relevant to the work you do.

Many accessibility courses don&#39;t follow this approach. Instead, they teach the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), from start to finish. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll absorb about 10% of them (there are 78 guidelines in total—quick, gimme eight).

There&#39;s nothing online that exactly mirrors this approach, but I&#39;ve done my best to approximate it with the resources here and in my [testing guide](https://github.com/katekalcevich/accessible-accessibility/blob/master/Digital%20accessibility%20testing%20tools.md).

## Start here

First, it helps to understand this key concept—why it&#39;s an inaccessible world that is the biggest disabler, not a person&#39;s body or mind.

Next, learn a bit about how people with disabilities use the web. If you prefer a non-video option, read the [Accessibility and me](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/category/accessibility-and-me/) articles.

- Cognitive disabilities: [How Persons with Disabilities Use the Web (video - first 22 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WveJjhwaEDI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=155)
- Vision disabilities: [How I Use Screen Reading And Magnification (10 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjKG4Tx9ER8)
- Pain/mobility disabilities: [Dragon Speech Recognition Assistive Technology (2 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usoTF68c6gY)

If you want to specialize in accessibility as a career path, consider getting the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals Web Accessibility Specialist Certification ($530 USD)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/wascertification).

Here are my favourite training and resources related to accessibility, grouped by job function.

## Coding

There are a lot of options here—let me clarify how to use them. Start with [Designing for easy interaction](https://alistapart.com/article/designing-for-easy-interaction) if you&#39;re new to web accessibility. The quick references are handy to use after your training is complete. Technology specific guidance are references you can use to look up concepts as you&#39;re developing.

The courses and webinars are your actual learning resources. Choose based on your budget (free or paid) and within the paid options, whether you prefer independent learning or instructor-led classes.

If you&#39;re serious about accessibility, I can&#39;t say enough good things about [Fable Tech Labs Inc](https://www.makeitfable.com/). They&#39;ve created a platform for remote usability testing with people with disabilities. This lets your team understand real barriers to accessibility and interact with real people. They also provide consulting services and accessibility workshops.

## UX design

Two practical training videos on how to add accessibility to your workflow—start with the foundations.

1. [UX Foundations: Accessibility (1 hour 20 minute video)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/ux-foundations-accessibility)
2. [Accessibility for Web Design (2 hour video)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/accessibility-for-web-design/)

This course is more theoretical than practical, but it gives you a lot of great context for accessible design. It&#39;s quite lengthy, so I consider it optional.

[Introduction to Web Accessibility (4 week online course, 4-5 hours per week)](https://www.edx.org/course/web-accessibility-introduction)

If you have the budget for paid learning, these two webinars cover more concepts than the free training videos.

## User research
One concern I hear from people who do user interviews is that they worry about offending research participants with disabilities. Microsoft has a series of seven short (1 to 2 minute) videos about [how to be more inclusive of people with disabilities](https://news.microsoft.com/stories/simplethingscount/) that can help.
