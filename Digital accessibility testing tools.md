# Digital accessibility testing tools

Tools to help you test for accessibility barriers. When you create digital content in an accessible way, more people can use your documents, website or app.

Accessibility is a team sport—everyone has a part to play. A robust web accessibility testing process could involve:

- writers checking if content is written in plain language
- designers checking if text colours have enough contrast and fonts are easy-to-read;  and including tab/reading order in their design specifications
- developers checking that interactive elements can be used with a screen reader and speech input
- devops checking for accessibility errors as part of continuous integration
- QA doing a final check using WAVE, tabbing through all elements with a keyboard and confirming that pages work when zoomed 200%
- user researchers [testing accessibility with real people](https://www.makeitfable.com/)

There&#39;s more testing you can do than what I&#39;ve listed above, but this is a great starting point and you can build on it once you&#39;ve mastered the basics of accessibility.

Here are my favourite accessibility testing tools, grouped by type.

## Automated WCAG compliance testing

### Automation / Integration

Add these tools to your environment to test for accessibility barriers during development. They check the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and highlight compliance errors.

- [Pa11y: command-line accessibility testing interface](https://pa11y.org/)
- [Automated Accessibility Testing Tool (AATT)](https://github.com/paypal/AATT)
- [Tenon: API-first, automated accessibility testing tool](https://tenon.io/)
- [Integrating Tenon](https://tenon.io/getcode.php)

### Browser extensions

Use these free tools to test web pages for accessibility barriers. They check the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and highlight compliance errors.

- [Axe (Chrome and Firefox)](https://www.deque.com/axe/axe-for-web/)
The Axe extension highlights errors on screen, explains what caused the error and how to fix it. Axe is great for toggling between the element on screen and the source code.
- [Easy Accessibility Testing with aXe (3.5 minute video)](https://youtu.be/FW1giWW5M9I)
- [WAVE (Chrome and Firefox)](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
The WAVE extension highlights errors on screen, explains what caused the error and how to fix it. WAVE allows you to turn page styles off to help narrow down exactly where an error is.
- [WAVE Help](https://wave.webaim.org/help)
- [tota11y: an accessibility visualization toolkit (all browsers)](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/)
The tota11y extension allows you to check one group of errors at a time (headings, contrast, links, etc.). It highlights errors on screen, displays the relevant code and has tips for fixing the errors.
- [taba11y (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/taba11y/aocppmckdocdjkphmofnklcjhdidgmga?hl=en)
The taba11y extension tabs through all focusable elements on a page and numbers them, so you can check tab order without tabbing through everything yourself.

## Manual testing tools

### Low vision

- [WCAG Color contrast checker (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wcag-color-contrast-check/plnahcmalebffmaghcpcmpaciebdhgdf?hl=en)
All the browser extensions check colour contrast. The WCAG color contrast checker _only_ checks colour contrast, nothing else. It will tell you if colours meet AA or AAA requirements for regular or large text. The colour picker tool lets you select colours on screen and test them.
- Check your font size—is it at least 16px?
- Zoom in 200%—does everything reflow so you can read without scrolling? or, even better, use a screen magnifier to test:
- [Windows magnifier (7 minute video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibu0BY-kAX4)
- [Use Magnifier to make things on the screen easier to see](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/11542/windows-use-magnifier-to-make-things-easier-to-see)
