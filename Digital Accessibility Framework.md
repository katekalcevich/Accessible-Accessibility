# Digital Accessibility Framework for Organizations

The building blocks of a successful digital accessibility program.

* * * * *

## 1\. Establish a foundation

### Identify an executive champion for accessibility

This doesn't have to be a full-time position, but the executive champion must: 

-   include accessibility in their [OKRs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIcpFZ5rbHc&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=Perdoo)/[KPIs](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/articles/what-is-a-key-performance-indicator)

-   bring accessibility to the table in all meetings

-   prioritize accessibility and help others see the value of it

In addition to an executive champion, you'll need a digital accessibility lead with technical expertise to lead the day-to-day work. 

A committee of accessibility champions from various parts of the organization can be very useful for coordinating accessibility efforts, sharing information accross the organization and avoiding a siloed approach to accessibility.

### Allocate budget for digital accessibility

You'll need funding to: 

-   acquire accessibility expertise (hire employees, contractors or procure vendors)

-   train your team on how to do digital accessibility

-   test accessibility using tools, assistive technology and people with disabilities

### Create a strategy for digital accessibility

The key parts of your initial digital accessibility strategy are:

-   where and when you will acquire your accessibility expertise

-   where in the organization digital accessibility will sit 

-   what culture and governance you want for digital accessibility

-   how the accessibility experts will support the digital team (your accessibility support model)

Regularly update your strategy based on whether you achieve your digital accessibility outcomes (see step 4).

## 2\. Train your team

### Establish a baseline understanding

Your entire digital team needs to understand:

-   the different types of disabilities people can have, 

-   the challenges they face with inaccessible websites and apps, and 

-   the types of assistive technology they use.

An accessibility bootcamp is an effective way of training large teams all at once.

### Implement role-based training

Beyond the baseline understanding of accessibility, 

-   project managers/scrum masters need to include accessibility in planning and sprint reviews

-   researchers need to include disabled people in interviews, testing and personas

-   designers need to know how to create designs with accessibility annotations

-   writers need to know how to write clearly and simply, how to create usable link text and headings, and how to describe images appropriately

-   developers need to know how to write accessible code and validate it

-   QA testers need to know how to use assistive technology to test user journeys

Role-based training can be delivered by an instructor in-house, outsourced to a vendor or through online learning courses.

### Create an integrated onboarding program

Once your entire digital team is trained in accessibility, you need a plan to keep it that way. All new employees, contractors and vendors will need accessibility training as part of onboarding. Your accessibility onboarding program needs to be integrated with your hiring and procurement processes.

## 3\. Change your processes

### Embed accessibility in procurement

As part of your procurement process, you must:

-   evaluate products for accessibility as part of your selection process

-   use experts to determine accessibility evaluation criteria

-   include accessibility in procurement contracts 

-   ensure that selected vendors understand accessibility requirements 

### Evaluate your digital processes for points of insertion

-   review your design system/style guide/branding for colour contrast, font readability and diverse representation of people in photos and illustrations

-   review your user research process for diversity and inclusion of people with disabilities in user interviews and usability testing

-   review your design process for ways to include accessibility in design deliverables and communicate requirements to developers

-   review your code review and approval process for opportunities to validate code for accessibility using automated tools

-   review your QA process for ways to add usability testing by assistive technology users prior to launch

-   review your analytics technology for new tools that can add accessibility to your analysis of website and app performance

### Communicate accountability for accessibility

Ensure that your entire digital team is aware of their accessibility responsibilities: 

-   individual contributors and their managers are accountable for the accessibility of work they do

-   an executive champion is accountable for the accessibility of the organization

-   product owners are accountable for the accessibility of their products

-   accessibility experts are accountable for creating standards and giving advice on training, testing, auditing and ongoing accessibility improvements

## 4\. Track your progress

How do you know if digital efforts are working? you have to decide what outcomes you want, measure your baseline and then measure the change as you implement an accessibility framework.

Stacey Barr writes about [how to move from measuring activity to measuring outcomes](https://www.staceybarr.com/measure-up/how-to-move-from-activity-measures-to-outcome-measures/). Here's an example:

Outcome: individual contributors and their managers are accountable for the accessibility of work they do

How to achieve: incorporate accessibility training into onboarding programs and performance reviews

Metrics: 

-   100% of new employees understand their role relevant accessibility requirements within 6 weeks of starting a new job (including internal transfers/promotions)

-   100% of employee performance reviews include an assessment of accessibility skills and contributions (ideally include a metric that can be averaged across all employees)

How to measure: 

-   test, survey or interview a percentage new employees post-training 

-   analyze the accessibility fields of performance review documents for completion and run a query to determine average skills/contributions across the organization 

### Implement testing tools and processes

Use automated accessibility testing tools like [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/), [Siteimprove](https://siteimprove.com/), [Tenon.io](https://tenon.io/), etc. and also test with assistive technology like screen readers, keyboard and magnifiers to catch accessibility issues that can't be found by automated testing tools.

Assistive technology testing can be outsourced to vendors that use a community of disabled testers.

[WCAG auditing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/) requires deep accessibility expertise and a large time commitment. Consider outsourcing audits, if they are required by legislation.

### Report on progress across the organization

Publish quarterly reports, a newsletter, a blog or host lunch n' learns, give talks, speak in sprint reviews–whatever works best for your team and culture to bring awareness of the progress being made in digital accessibility.

### Publish an accessibility statement

Writing about your accessibility commitment and welcoming feedback opens the door to positive dialogue with your customers who have disabilities. Responding to feedback in a constructive and helpful way is critical.

Consider also promoting the accessibility status of your websites and apps when you market them. People with disabilities represent an untapped market segment and a considerable business opportunity.
