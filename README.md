# Accessible Accessibility
Making digital accessibility easier to understand.

I've created a list of [learning resources](https://github.com/katekalcevich/accessible-accessibility/blob/master/Learn%20about%20digital%20accessibility.md) and [testing tools](https://github.com/katekalcevich/accessible-accessibility/blob/master/Digital%20accessibility%20testing%20tools.md) for people new to accessibility. There are many free options. I've only in shared person training recommendations for Ontario, Canada (that's where I live).

For organizations, I have a [Digital Accessibility Framework](https://github.com/katekalcevich/accessible-accessibility/blob/master/Digital%20Accessibility%20Framework.md).

Suggestions, edits and changes are welcome.

Please read the [theory section](https://github.com/katekalcevich/accessible-accessibility/blob/master/Learn%20about%20digital%20accessibility.md#theory) before suggesting training. I don't recommend training that focuses on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Based on my experience working in the field since 2001, it's not a good starting point.
